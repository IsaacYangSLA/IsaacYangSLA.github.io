<p>Deep learning, the fastest growing field in AI, is empowering immense progress in scientific and real-life applications.
It has been widely accepted that the more data used in the deep learning training, the better models can be achieved.
However, those deep-learning algorithms are meeting difficult challenges when applied to the real-world, especially in
the financial and health care areas. The data in these areas are typically subject to strong privacy regulations.
It is often impossible to share data across different organizations. Annotated data is also hard to obtain and it
represents an asset for individual institutions.</p>
<p>Hence, the question becomes: how can you obtain models as good as those that can be obtained training on large datasets without violating privacy and
property constraints? One approach to solve this issue is to use federated learning. Different institutions contribute
to the construction of a powerful model by doing collaborative training without sharing any data. A generic pre-trained
model is fine-tuned for a specific application or a specific patient population. Different institutions share the
trained model, not the actual data! With this approach, you can achieve the goal of training better models, while still
protecting the data privacy.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-does-federated-learning-work">
<h2>How does federated learning work<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-federated-learning-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="../_images/fl_overview.png" src="../_images/fl_overview.png" style="height: 560px;" />
<p>Federated learning is split into two parts: the server and the client. The server manages the overall model training
progress and broadcasts the original model to all the participating clients. Model training happens locally on each
client’s side. This way, the server does not need to access the training data. The data is protected with the private
access on each client. All the clients are sharing the model updates instead of the data. Each client has its own
privacy controls on what percentage of the model weights will be sent to the server for aggregation.</p>
<p>Once the server receives the latest round of models from the clients, the server can build its own algorithm on how to
aggregate the model. It could be a simple average from all the clients, or based on some weights from the historical
contributions from the clients.</p>
<p>The server has the overall control of how many rounds of federal learning training to conduct. The participating clients
can be added or removed during any round of the training. Federated learning provides benefits for every
participant: a stronger central model, and better local models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="federated-learning-system-architecture">
<h2>Federated learning system architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#federated-learning-system-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="../_images/fl_overall_workflow.png" src="../_images/fl_overall_workflow.png" style="height: 430px;" />
<p>When running a federated learning model training, a server training service must first be started. The server session
controls the minimum number of clients needed to start a round of FL training and the maximum number of clients that
can join a round. If a client intends to join a FL session, it must first submit a login request to apply for FL
training. The server will check the credentials of the FL client and perform the authentication process to validate the
client. If the authentication is successful, the server sends a FL token back to the client for use in the following FL
client-server communication. Otherwise, it sends an authentication rejection if the client can not be authenticated.</p>
<p>Then the client sends another request to get the current training model from the server to start the current round of
model training. The client has its own control on how many epochs it will run during each round of FL training. Once the
client finishes the current round of training, it sends the updated model to the server using the existing FL token.
After the server receives all the updated models from all the participating clients, it performs the model aggregation
based on the weights algorithms and gets the updated overall training model. This completes the current round of the FL
training, and the FL training continues until it reaches the max rounds set on the server, <cite>num_rounds</cite> in the server
configuration file.</p>
